I used expo framework to create, develop and test this application. I choose this framework due to lightweight.

I used this expo-cli to generate apk.

The expo provide a online tool which helps to generate signged .apk. Please follow below command line to generate .apk and follow the steps.

expo build:android -t apk

and this will ask few steps to generate apk file.
